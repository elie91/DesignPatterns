Builder is a creational design pattern, which allows constructing complex objects step by step.
Unlike other creational patterns, Builder doesn’t require products to have a common interface. 
That makes it possible to produce different products using the same construction process.

Usage examples: 
The Builder pattern is a well-known pattern in TypeScript world. 
It’s especially useful when you need to create an object with lots of possible configuration options.

Identification: 
The Builder pattern can be recognized in a class, which has a single creation method and several methods to configure the resulting object. 
Builder methods often support chaining (for example, someBuilder.setValueA(1).setValueB(2).create()).
