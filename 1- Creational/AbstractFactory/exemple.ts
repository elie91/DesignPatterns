Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern
which solves the problem of creating entire product families without specifying their concrete classes.

-> Use the Abstract Factory when your code needs to work with various families of related products, 
but you donâ€™t want it to depend on the concrete classes of those products; 
they might be unknown beforehand or you simply want to allow for future extensibility. 

Usage examples: 
The Abstract Factory pattern is pretty common in TypeScript code. 
Many frameworks and libraries use it to provide a way to extend and customize their standard components.

Identification: 
The pattern is easy to recognize by methods, which return a factory object. 
Then, the factory is used for creating specific sub-components.

Complexity: 2/3
Popularity: 3/3
