Mediator is a behavioral design pattern that reduces coupling between components of a program by making them communicate indirectly, 
through a special mediator object.

The Mediator makes it easy to modify, extend and reuse individual components because theyâ€™re no longer dependent on the dozens of other classes.

-> Use the Iterator pattern when your collection has a complex data structure under the hood, but you want to hide its complexity from clients (either for convenience or security reasons).
-> Use the pattern to reduce duplication of the traversal code across your app.
-> Use the Iterator when you want your code to be able to traverse different data structures or when types of these structures are unknown beforehand.

Usage examples: 
The most popular usage of the Mediator pattern in TypeScript code is facilitating communications between GUI components of an app. 
The synonym of the Mediator is the Controller part of MVC pattern.
